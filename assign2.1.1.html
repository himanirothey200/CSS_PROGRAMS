                        <span>Microsoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen on April 4, 1975, to develop and sell BASIC 
                            interpreters for the Altair 8800. It rose to dominate the personal computer operating system market 
                            with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by Windows. The company's 1986 initial public offering (IPO), 
                            and subsequent rise in its share price, created three billionaires and an estimated 12,000  millionaires 
                            among Microsoft employees. Since the 1990s, it has increasingly diversified from the operating system market 
                            and has made a number of corporate acquisitions, </span>
